        <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>
            I grew up as a suburban kid, born and raised in <a href="https://www.aurora-il.org/">Aurora, IL</a>. The second largest city in Illinois. It was there I attended <a href="http://www.sd129.org/westhigh">West Aurora High School</a> and discovered my passion for programming and computer science.  
          </p>
          <p>
            I took a C++ class to learn the fundementals of programming. From there I began teaching myself. I started a software development company known as Rogue Labs at 16. It was successful to the point that I had no need for a part-time job while in school.
          </p>
          <p>
            I ran the business until the end of my freshman year at the <a href="http://web.iit.edu/">Illinois Institute of Technology</a> in Chicago. That's when I sold the business to my close partner so that I could focus on my studies and becoming a young professional. 
          </p>
          <h3>Inspiration</h3>
          <p>
            I draw a great deal of inspiration from many different types of people, from many walks of life. I truely belive what defines a persons character is how they overcome the adversity in life.
